                Hi, I'm Sathish!<br>
Bringing clean water to people is not just my business — it’s my purpose.
            </h3>

                My Journey 

<br><br>
2013 – Just Getting Started
<br>

I was working as a delivery driver, supplying 30-liter water cans around the city. No company name, no team, no plant — just me and a vehicle. But in my mind, I had a clear goal: one day, I’ll start my own water supply business.
<br><br>

2015 – First Step Towards the Dream
<br>

I took a big decision and rented a small purification plant. It was the beginning of Pure Aqua. There were no customers waiting. Some days, I’d sell just one can. But I never gave up. Early mornings, late nights — I kept the plant running every single day.
<br><br>

2017 – Business Picks Up
<br>

After years of consistent hard work, things slowly started moving. Customers started coming back. Word of mouth helped a lot. The trust people showed kept me motivated to maintain the same quality and timely delivery.
<br><br>

2020 – Pandemic Challenges
<br>

The COVID pandemic hit everyone hard. But even during lockdowns and restrictions, we made sure our customers got clean drinking water on time. We followed all safety protocols and kept deliveries going without fail. That year, I also expanded the business — started supplying packaged drinking water bottles in bulk for offices, hospitals, and apartment complexes.
<br><br>

2022 – Growth and Recognition
<br>

Our packaged water bottles gained huge demand. Bulk orders started increasing from events, shops, and companies. We added more delivery routes, upgraded our purification setup, and brought in more helping hands. Still, I personally ensured every delivery was on time.
<br><br>

2025 – Still on the Same Mission
<br>

Now, we run operations every single day from early morning till night — just like I did in the beginning. We’ve never missed a delivery, never delayed an order. Whether it’s one can or a full truckload, our commitment remains the same.
<br><br>

This journey wasn’t built overnight. It was built with passion, patience, and a promise — to deliver pure water, always on time.
